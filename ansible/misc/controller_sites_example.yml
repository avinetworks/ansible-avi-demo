# This is script to synchronize the controller sites information across
# multiple controllers. It takes the information about controllers
# from the list of controllersites variable.
# takes the common avi_credentials and updates it with each controllersite
# ipaddress. The expectation is that admins have SSO between the controllers
# so the same credentials should work across controllers.
